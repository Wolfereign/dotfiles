# DotFiles For My Linux Preferences

## Setup Instructions
```
cd ~ 
git clone https://github.com/Wolfereign/.dotfiles.git 
bash ~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh
```
 
Any files with the extension of ".symlink"  will get symlinked to '~/' and the ".symlink" extension will be stripped.  Also the file will be renamed with a '.' prefix.
